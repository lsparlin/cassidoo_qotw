# Christmas Tree solution
ruby solution to Christmas Tree interview challenge from Rendesvous with Cassidoo

____
This week’s question is brought to you by Sourcegraph!
Given a file named merry-christmas.txt that has a single integer x in it, write a script to generate a Christmas tree with asterisks (*) and output it as happy-holidays.txt. The tree should have a height of x, and if merry-christmas.txt is empty, the height should be 25 asterisks tall. 

Example (you can be flexible with your output, but this might be helpful for you as a starting point): 

```
// merry-christmas.txt
3

// happy-holidays.txt
  *
 ***
*****
```
____
## Run the code
`ruby tree.rb`

```bash
───────┬──────────────────────────
       │ File: happy-holidays.txt
───────┼──────────────────────────
   1 ~ │          *
   2 ~ │         ***
   3 ~ │        *****
   4 ~ │       *******
   5 ~ │      *********
   6 ~ │     ***********
   7 ~ │    *************
   8 ~ │   ***************
   9 ~ │  *****************
